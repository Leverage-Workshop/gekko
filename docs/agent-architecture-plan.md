# Plan: Turn the "Gekko" NQ-Futures Gem into an Autonomous Agent

## Context

Today, "Gekko" is a Google Gem (Gemini Pro 3.1) that analyzes NQ futures. The trader
manually uploads, every time he wants an update: 3 chart screenshots (HTF 30-min, TPO,
execution/footprint), `mgi_static_levels.json`, and `execution_bar_data.rolling.csv`,
and the Gem returns a "Morning Briefing" as markdown. All inputs are produced by the
user's custom **Sierra Chart ACSIL studies** on his Windows machine; he also has studies
that export volume profiles and volume-delta profiles **as data**.

Four problems motivate the rebuild:
1. Manual loop — he must import files and send a message for every update.
2. Markdown-only output in the Gemini web app — no real visualization.
3. Gemini Pro 3.1 is slow.
4. `instructions.md` and `tactical-companion-playbook.md` are redundant and incoherent
   (an artifact of how Gems force everything into one prompt + a "silent retrieval" hack).

**Intended outcome:** an advisory-only agent that (a) runs analysis **on demand from the
web UI** — a "Run Briefing" button for a full briefing and a "Check Entry" button for an
entry-validity eval at the current price, (b) renders briefings as a rich web UI (real
terrain/zone map, not markdown), (c) is materially faster, and (d) has a clean, deduped
knowledge base with computable doctrine moved into code.

### Decisions locked with the user
- **Scope:** Advisory only — never connects to a broker or places orders.
- **Inputs:** Hybrid — keep screenshots (LVN/spatial detection is hard to code) **and**
  use the structured data exports (volume profile, delta profile, MGI, exec CSV).
- **Triggering:** On demand only — two UI buttons ("Run Briefing", "Check Entry"). No
  scheduler, no live price feed, no proximity automation.
- **Notifications:** Simple web notifications (he's at his desk).
- **Models (latency goal):** Default **`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`** (vision + strong
  reasoning, faster than Gemini Pro 3.1) for full briefings; **`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`**
  for the cheap "Check Entry"/"is this entry warranted" eval triage;
  **`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`** behind a config flag for max-fidelity reviews.
- **LLM access:** via the **Vercel AI SDK** with **OpenRouter** as the provider gateway
  (model IDs are OpenRouter-namespaced as above). Lets us swap models from `config.model_id`
  with no code change. `generateObject` + the Zod `Briefing` schema gives constrained JSON
  output; image message parts cover the screenshots.
- **Deliverable of this planning round:** save this finalized plan as a markdown file in the
  repo (e.g. `docs/agent-architecture-plan.md`). **No app code is built yet.**

### Stack
Next.js (run locally on the trading machine — Vercel deployment descoped, see feat-021) +
trigger.dev (scheduling/workflows) + Supabase (Postgres + object storage + Realtime) +
Vercel AI SDK → OpenRouter (LLM). One small **local uploader** (Node) on the Windows box
bridges Sierra Chart to the app.

## Architecture & Data Flow

```
[Sierra Chart / Windows]
  ├─ ACSIL export studies ──▶ C:\gekko\export\  (mgi_static_levels.json,
  │                                               execution_bar_data.rolling.csv,

  │                                               full-rotation-delta.vbp.md)
  └─ Chart image auto-dump ──▶ C:\gekko\export\  (htf_clean.png, tpo.png,
                                                  execution_clean.png)
  Note: current price/time live in mgi_static_levels.json (current.price/.time),
  extracted on ingest — not a separate field.

[Local uploader (Node + chokidar)]
  └─ watches export folder, debounces, bundles ─── POST /api/ingest (multipart, ~30s)

====================== CLOUD (Next.js + trigger.dev + Supabase) ======================
  /api/ingest        → store raw bundle (files→storage, mgi→jsonb)  [no auto-analyze]
  /api/briefings/run → tasks.trigger("analyze-task", {triggerReason:"manual"})   ◀ UI button
  /api/eval/run      → tasks.trigger("eval-task")                                 ◀ UI button
  trigger.dev:
    ├─ analyze-task (full-briefing LLM task):
    │     1) deterministic engine (TS)  2) Claude (vision+structured JSON)
    │     3) validate (Zod)  4) persist briefing + refresh entry_levels  5) notify
    ├─ eval-task (entry-eval triage; current price = latest bundle):
    │     load latest bundle + active entry_levels → triage model → EvalResult
    │     → validate (Zod) → persist eval_results → notify
    └─ notify-task (web push / realtime)
  Supabase: config, raw_bundles, briefings, entry_levels, eval_results
  Next.js UI: terrain/zone map (SVG/canvas), briefing render, eval result, two trigger buttons, config
```

**Why a local uploader (not direct ACSIL HTTP):** ACSIL *can* POST JSON
(`sc.MakeHTTPPOSTRequest`), but it can't easily screenshot+upload a PNG, and embedding
auth/retry in C++ is brittle. A ~100-line `chokidar` watcher isolates all fragile local
concerns (file-write timing, screen capture, retries, bearer auth) in one debuggable JS
process.

**Current price (no live feed):** Sierra Chart exports the bundle every ~30s, so the latest
`raw_bundles` row is fresh; the eval uses its `current_price`. There is no ACSIL price
heartbeat, no `/api/price`, and no `latest_price` table — avoiding both the C++ HTTP path and
any third-party feed cost / data-redistribution licensing.

## Deterministic Engine vs LLM (the key split)

Move computable doctrine OUT of the prompt into TypeScript (`/lib/engine/`). This lowers
latency (smaller prompt) and removes an error class (gap math, R/R arithmetic the LLM gets
wrong). Reference: the math lives today in `gem-files/tactical-companion-playbook.md`.

**TypeScript modules (engine computes facts, hands them to the model):**
- `terrainZones.ts` — contiguous Stratosphere→Abyss zone stack with the "No-Gap" invariant
  (`Price[N] === Price2[N+1]`); LLM supplies border prices, code assembles+validates.
- `riskReward.ts` — direction-aware 3:1 R/R gate; "stops never widen" enforced vs prior briefing.
- `magnetCheck.ts` / `lvnDetection.ts` — Trench/Wall/Magnet + LVN detection from the parsed,
  joined **volume/delta profile arrays** (peak/valley + gradient detection; see *Profile Export
  Format* below), cross-referenced to MGI levels. Feasible from the *data* (it was "tricky" only
  from the *image*).
- `mgiPriority.ts` — Tier 1/2/3 hierarchy + daily priority sort; compute nearest Tier-1
  border above/below price.
- `ripStatus.ts` — Vanguard Protocol Green/Yellow/Red from price-vs-Rip + DeltaIntensity.
- `deltaTelemetry.ts` — reduce the ~250-row exec CSV to a compact summary (recent delta
  trend, sign, ±3/±4 extremes, Leg-VWAP-relative position).

**Leave to the LLM (Claude Sonnet 4.6):** reading the screenshots for what data can't
capture — absorption-vs-exhaustion *shape*, Three-Push Exhaustion / Flush-&-Reload
*patterns*, poor highs/single prints on the TPO, confirming delta clustering aligns with
the engine's borders — plus synthesis/judgment (Law of Asymmetric Initiative, Campaign
Boundary Override, macro-vs-micro conflict resolution) and the persona narrative.

**Code-owned LVN flow:** `lvnDetection.ts` computes LVN/HVN node prices from the VbP
volume series and they are authoritative — there is **no** vision round-trip and the
model is **not** asked to confirm or adjust node prices (chart histograms are lossy
renderings of the exact numeric data the engine already holds). The model reads the
screenshots only for perception the data can't give (absorption/exhaustion shape, TPO
single prints, delta clustering). See feat-014 / feat-018 in `feature_list.json`.

### Profile Export Format (LOCKED — from the four samples in `chart-data/`)

Four profile exports, all Markdown with an **identical structure** (feat-036):
- **HTF volume profiles** — `four-hundred-rotation.vbp.md` (anchored to the current 400-pt
  rotation, medium-term) and `rolling-five-day.vbp.md` (last five days, long-term). Bin Size 8
  ticks → 2.0-pt step; CSV header `Price,Volume`.
- **Execution delta profiles** — `half-rotation-delta.vbp.md` (~35-pt anchor) and
  `full-rotation-delta.vbp.md` (~75-pt anchor). Bin Size 9 ticks → 2.25-pt step; CSV header
  `Price,Delta` — **signed** (buy − sell) per bin; negative = sell-dominant.

Shared file shape:
- `## Metadata` bullets: Profile Name, Profile Description, **Tick Size** (0.25), **Bin Size (Ticks)**.
- `## Summary` bullets: **POC Price**, **Value Area High**, **Value Area Low** — read directly; do **not** recompute VA.
- `## Volume Profile Data` → a fenced ` ```csv ` block, two columns, **prices descending**.

Parser rules (`/lib/engine/parseProfile.ts`):
- Read `tickSize`/`binSize` from Metadata each run (don't hardcode the step); derive the
  expected step and validate row spacing.
- Distinguish volume from delta files by the CSV header's **2nd column** (`Volume` vs `Delta`), not just filename.
- Each file parses standalone (`parseVbpProfile` / `parseDeltaProfile`). There is **no VbP↔delta
  join** — the volume and delta exports sit on different bin grids (2.0 vs 2.25-pt steps), so a
  per-bin price join can never match (feat-036 removed it).

Engine consumption: `lvnDetection.ts` runs on **both VbP volume** series independently (nodes
labeled `rotation` / `fiveDay`; a five-day node is structurally more significant);
`magnetCheck.ts` magnets = POC/VAH/VAL + HVN peaks from the **rotation** profile;
`terrainZones.ts` assembles the zone stack over the **rotation** profile (volume structure only);
`absorption.ts` scans each **delta** profile for one-sided bin stacks and reports them as
**absorption candidates** — the model confirms each against price stalling on the execution chart.

## Knowledge Restructure

Drop the Gem "silently retrieve the doctrine" pattern. Dedupe `instructions.md` and
`tactical-companion-playbook.md` (they overlap on the intelligence sequence, Magnet Check,
Asymmetric Initiative, Leg-VWAP rule, output formats). New layout:

```
/knowledge
  /system
    persona.md         # Gekko persona, tone, ADHD UX rules (≤2 highlights, one action)
    constraints.md     # Hardcoded non-negotiables as guardrails (color=side, stops never
                       #   widen, entries only at borders, Leg VWAP rule, Magnet prohibition,
                       #   Asymmetric Initiative + Campaign Boundary Override)
    output-schema.md   # Prose description mirroring the Zod schema
  /doctrine            # Model reads for PERCEPTION/JUDGMENT only
    patterns.md        # consolidate the 4 cheat sheets (absorption/exhaustion,
                       #   rebid/reoffer, failed-breakout, flush-&-reload)
    chart-reading.md   # consolidated <chart_interpretation>
    glossary.md        # MGI glossary (tiering logic itself lives in mgiPriority.ts)
  /schema
    briefing.schema.ts # Zod = single source of truth for the output contract
```

- The "Intelligence Processing Sequence" stops being a prompt waypoint list — it becomes
  the `analyze-task` orchestration (engine steps in code, then one model call).
- Static doctrine is assembled into the **cached prompt prefix** (Anthropic prompt caching:
  ~0.1× read cost + lower latency). Through the Vercel AI SDK this is set via the Anthropic
  provider's `cache_control` / `providerOptions` (passed through OpenRouter) on the system
  content — **wire this explicitly; it's the main cost/latency lever, not an afterthought.**
  Volatile per-run data (MGI JSON, CSV telemetry, screenshots, current price/time) goes in
  the user message **after** the cached prefix — never interpolated into the system prompt
  (that would invalidate the cache each run). Min cacheable prefix clears easily
  (2048 tok Sonnet / 4096 tok Haiku).
- **Cache TTL:** runs are user-initiated (button clicks), so there's no fixed interval to
  tune against. Use the default 5-min TTL; bursts of clicks reuse the warm doctrine prefix.
- **Output is JSON, not markdown** — use the AI SDK `generateObject` with the Zod `Briefing`
  schema; the Next.js UI renders tables and the terrain map from the object. The old CSV
  terrain map becomes a `terrain.zones[]` array drawn as a real zone map.

### Output contract (`briefing.schema.ts`)
```ts
Briefing = {
  meta: { createdAt, triggerReason, currentPrice, htfTrend, ripStatus },
  overview: { currentPosition: string[], structuralArchitecture: string[],
              orderFlowContext: string[], keyInflections: {level:number, why:string}[] },
  terrain: { zones: {color, top, bottom, label}[],     // contiguous, engine-validated
             levels: {price, label, kind:'trench'|'wall'|'magnet'|'mgi'}[] },
  primary: Objective, secondary: Objective,
  dangerZones: { area:string, why:string }[]
}
Objective = { macroGoal, rationale, direction:'long'|'short',
  entries: {label, price, trigger}[], stops: {label, price, invalidation}[],
  targets: {label:'T1'|'T2'|'T3', price, description}[], rr:number }  // rr from riskReward.ts
```

The **eval-task** ("Check Entry") emits a separate, lighter contract — the `instructions.md`
eval logic (ENTER/WAIT/NOT VALID, else "no entry near"):
```ts
EvalResult = {
  meta: { createdAt, currentPrice, nearEntry:boolean, zone?:string },
  status: 'ENTER' | 'WAIT' | 'NOT_VALID' | 'NO_ENTRY_NEAR',
  evaluatedLevel?: { label:string, price:number, direction:'long'|'short' },
  direction?: 'long'|'short',
  trigger?: string, stop?: number, targets?: number[],
  reason: string
}
```

## Persistence (Supabase / Postgres)

```
config(id, model_id='claude-sonnet-4-6', triage_model_id='claude-haiku-4-5', rr_min=3.0, updated_at)
raw_bundles(id, received_at, mgi_json jsonb, exec_csv_ref, vol_profile_ref, delta_profile_ref,
            htf_png_ref, tpo_png_ref, exec_png_ref, current_price, is_stale)
briefings(id, bundle_id fk, created_at, trigger_reason, model_id, htf_trend, rip_status,
          terrain jsonb, primary_obj jsonb, secondary_obj jsonb, danger_zones jsonb,
          overview jsonb, raw_model_json jsonb)
entry_levels(id, briefing_id fk, objective, label, price, direction, stop, targets numeric[],
             active bool default true, created_at)   -- eval-task evaluates active=true only
eval_results(id, bundle_id fk, created_at, model_id, near_entry bool, status,  -- ENTER|WAIT|NOT_VALID|NO_ENTRY_NEAR
             evaluated_level_id fk, direction, trigger, stop, targets numeric[],
             reason, current_price, raw_model_json jsonb)
```
On each new briefing: set prior `entry_levels.active=false`, insert the new set. Files
(PNGs, CSVs) go to Supabase Storage; rows hold refs. Small JSON (mgi) stored inline. Current
price is read from the latest `raw_bundles` row (no separate hot-price store).

---

## trigger.dev Tasks
- `analyze-task` — full-briefing LLM task, triggered on demand from `/api/briefings/run`
  ("Run Briefing" button): load latest bundle → engine → AI SDK `generateObject` via
  OpenRouter (images + engine facts, Zod `Briefing` schema, cached doctrine prefix) → Zod
  validate → persist briefing + refresh `entry_levels` → trigger notify. Checks bundle
  freshness and flags staleness; never serves stale as fresh. Uses retries; logs model/cost
  to run metadata.
- `eval-task` — entry-eval triage, triggered on demand from `/api/eval/run` ("Check Entry"
  button): load latest bundle (current price = `raw_bundles.current_price`) + active
  `entry_levels` → AI SDK `generateObject` via OpenRouter with the **triage model**
  (`config.triage_model_id`, default `claude-haiku-4-5`; images + delta telemetry, Zod
  `EvalResult` schema) implementing the `instructions.md` eval logic → Zod validate →
  persist `eval_results` → trigger notify.
- `notify-task` — thin; sends the alert so notification failures don't fail analysis.

## Web Notifications
Start simple: **Notification API + Service Worker**, driven by **Supabase Realtime** on
the `briefings`/`eval_results` channel — fires on a new briefing or eval result while the
tab is open/backgrounded, no VAPID setup. Add **Web Push (VAPID + `web-push`)** later only
if "tab fully closed" alerting is needed.

---

## Phased Build Order

**Phase 0 — De-risk (do first; these are the real unknowns):**
1. **DONE** — profile DATA format confirmed from the four samples now in the repo
   (`chart-data/*.vbp.md` — two HTF volume, two execution delta); parsing spec locked (see
   *Profile Export Format*). Remaining Phase-0 step: validate `lvnDetection`/`magnetCheck`
   output against a hand-labeled chart. *(The engine is the system's main edge over the Gem.)*
2. Prove Sierra Chart **chart-image auto-export** yields clean, consistently-cropped PNGs on
   a timer. *(If flaky, the "remove the manual loop" goal degrades.)*

**Phase 1 — Thinnest end-to-end loop (reproduce the Gem, on demand):**
Supabase schema + `/api/ingest`; local uploader bundling the existing files; `analyze-task`
calling `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` via the AI SDK + OpenRouter with images + raw data
(no engine yet) → JSON → persist; bare Next.js page rendering the briefing JSON with a
"Run Briefing" button → `/api/briefings/run`. Ship it.

**Phase 2 — Deterministic engine:** build `deltaTelemetry`, `mgiPriority`, `ripStatus`,
then `lvnDetection`/`magnetCheck`/`terrainZones`/`riskReward`; inject engine facts, shrink
the prompt; add the terrain/zone-map UI.

**Phase 3 — On-demand eval + notifications:** "Check Entry" button → `/api/eval/run` →
`eval-task` (Haiku triage, eval logic vs active `entry_levels` at the latest bundle's
price); Notification API + Realtime; config UI (model, triage model, rr_min).

**Phase 4 — Hardening:** staleness detection; Web Push (tab-closed); cost/latency
observability; Opus flag for high-conviction reviews.

---

## Verification (end-to-end)
- **Phase 0:** unit tests for engine math against a hand-labeled chart (LVN/Trench/Wall/
  Magnet, contiguous zones with no gaps, R/R values).
- **Phase 1:** drop a known bundle into the export folder → uploader POSTs → click "Run
  Briefing" → exactly one `analyze-task` runs → a briefing row appears → the Next.js page
  renders primary/secondary objectives and danger zones. Compare the output against the
  existing sample briefing for parity.
- **Phase 3:** with active `entry_levels` present, click "Check Entry" → exactly one
  `eval-task` runs → an `eval_results` row appears with status (ENTER/WAIT/NOT_VALID or
  NO_ENTRY_NEAR) → the UI renders it and a web notification fires.
- **Throughout:** assert `response.model` is the configured model; confirm prompt-cache
  hits via `usage.cache_read_input_tokens > 0` on repeat runs.

## Top Risks (ranked)
1. Engine **LVN/Magnet detection quality** — the main edge. Format is now locked from samples;
   residual risk is detection accuracy, validated against a hand-labeled chart in Phase 0.
2. **Chart-image auto-export reliability** — validate in Phase 0.
3. **Single-machine availability** — no running Sierra Chart/uploader = no data; must detect
   and surface staleness, never serve stale briefings as fresh.
4. **Doctrine drift** between engine code and `constraints.md` guardrails — keep in sync,
   engine authoritative.
